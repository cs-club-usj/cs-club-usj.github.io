On May 31, 2025, the Computer Science Club (CSC) at Saint Joseph University of Beirut (USJ) transformed the Sciences and Technology Campus (CST) in Mar Roukoz into a dynamic arena of code, logic, and teamwork. The occasion? The first edition of **The Computer Science Rally Paper**, a first of its kind academic showdown built from the ground up to ignite curiosity and test the determination of Lebanon's brightest high school minds.

The event kicked off at 10:00 AM with a warm welcome, coffee, team photos, and rising anticipation filling the atmosphere. Over **40 students from 15 schools** across Lebanon, divided into teams of three, arrived, ready to tackle and conquer a gauntlet of **20 challenges** strategically scattered around the campus.

So, how exactly was The Computer Science Rally Paper executed? Imagine a treasure hunt and a hackathon fused together. Teams raced to navigate physical checkpoints across the campus, uncovering clues and solving challenges that span **the entire computer science spectrum**: Artificial Intelligence (AI), cybersecurity, networking, programming, web development, algorithms, computer architecture, logical reasoning, and math. It's academic, but it's also a race where mental agility was paired with physical navigation.

Each challenge demanded sharp thinking, teamwork, and creative problem-solving. However, the students came prepared, driven not only by competition but by genuine curiosity and the will to learn.

Throughout the day, **Campus-J** documented the action, thanks to the coverage of reporter Lynn El Farran and photographer Sergio Chebly. The closing ceremony wrapped up the event at 5:00 PM, celebrating and honoring not just winners, but the collective ambition and spirit students showed.

The Computer Science Rally Paper was more than just a competition. It reshaped and redefined how young students experience computer science. The prizes weren't just recognition; they were gateways and fuel to keep building and reaching new heights that seemed impossible before. It has set a new standard for computer science competitions in Lebanon.

What students gained on May 31 wasn't just a score; it was perspective. The Computer Science Rally Paper proved that learning can be a challenge, but with the right spark, it becomes a passion. And for the students who rose to that challenge, the future just got a little closer.

The success of this first edition and the momentum built on May 31 lit a fuse that's already pushing plans forward. As the 2025â€“2026 academic year approaches, the CSC is thinking bigger, aiming higher, and building on everything this event proved possible. What started as a bold idea is now a movement. And this is only the beginning.
