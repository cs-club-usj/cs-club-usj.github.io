## Challenges

### Types

We distinguish two types of challenges:

#### Non-Interactive Challenges (NICs)

- Do **not** require staff supervision.
- Award a fixed number of points upon successful completion.
- Can be attempted **multiple times**, but each additional attempt is penalized.

#### Interactive Challenges (ICs)

- Require supervision by a staff member.
- Composed of multiple **checkpoints**, each awarding a fixed number of points.
- Each IC has multiple checkpoints, each awarding a fixed number of points. Teams can earn partial credit by solving only some of the checkpoints.
- Can be attempted **only once**.

### Scoring System & Submissions

- Each challenge has a predefined score.
- Completing a challenge successfully adds to the teamâ€™s total score.
- A **live leaderboard** will be displayed across the campus to track team progress in real time.
- All submissions must be made at HQ, **except for ICs**, which are validated on-site by a staff member.

## Rules

- Teams may attempt challenges in **any order**.
- Only **one challenge** may be solved at a time.
- All team members must be present during the attempt of any challenge.
- Teams are **not allowed** to keep the problem sheets.
- Use of online resources or AI tools is strictly prohibited.
- Mobile phones or laptops (other than those provided specifically for the challenges) are not allowed.
- Any **cheating or rule violation** will result in immediate disqualification.
- ICs may be attempted **only once**, with scoring based on completed checkpoints.
- NICs may be attempted multiple times, but each additional attempt incurs a penalty.
