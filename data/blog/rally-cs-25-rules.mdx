## Challenges

### Types

We distinguish two types of challenges:

#### Non-Interactive Challenges (NICs)

- These challenges do not require the supervision of a staff member.
- They award a fixed amount of points.
- NICs can be attampted multiple times but each attempt is penalized.

#### Interactive Challenges (ICs)

- These challenges require the supervision of a staff member.
- Each IC has multiple checkpoints, each awarding a fixed number of points. Teams can earn partial credit by solving only some of the checkpoints.
- Can be attempted **only once**.

### Scoring System & Submissions

- Each challenge has a predefined score value.
- Successfully completing a challenge increases the team's score accordingly.
- ICs consist of multiple checkpoints, each awarding a fixed number of points. Teams can earn partial credit based on the checkpoints they solve and reach.
- A live leaderboard will be available to track progress and will be displayed on vertical screens placed throughout the campus.
- Submissions must be made by the team at HQ, except for ICs, which are validated on the spot by a staff member.

## Rules

- Teams can complete challenges in any order they choose.
- Teams must only solve **one challenge at a time.**
- All team members must be present while solving a specific challenge.
- They can not keep the problem sheet with them.
- Use of online resources or AI tools is strictly prohibited.
- Any form of cheating or rule violation will lead to disqualification.
- ICs can **only be attempted once.** Teams earn points based on the amount of checkpoints they solve.
- NICs can be attampted multiple times but each attempt is penalized.
